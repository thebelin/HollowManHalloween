Additional Hardware
___________________________
To maintain power through the intended presentation duration, additional battery systems are required for the broadcast unit.  A portable USB battery pack will be used to power the router and act as a backup power for the android encoder.  The router will provide a secure wiFi connection to the encoder and to the presentation player.

A mounting system is required for the playback and the capture devices, and a harness can be adapted from an A-frame shirt and cases designed for the devices being mounted.
